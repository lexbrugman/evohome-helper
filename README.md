# evohome-helper
This tool adds presence detection to any evohome installation, turning the heating off when no-one is home. It also adjusts to your heating schedule in the decision to turn your heating off when you're not at home, making sure you still have a warm home after coming back from work.

Depends on homeassistant for presence and weather information. Can be used as an add-on within homeassistant.
